## Usage
to be updated later.
### Installation

Download the script file using [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget) / [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) / [git](https://git-scm.com)
 Open `Terminal` and run:

**via wget**

```bash
# Download and run via wget
/bin/bash -c "$(wget -O - https://github.com/vi-ku/setup_linux_dev/raw/HEAD/setup.sh)"
```

**via curl**

```bash
# Download and run via curl
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fL https://github.com/vi-ku/setup_linux_dev/raw/HEAD/setup.sh)"
```

**via git or browser**

```bash
# Download via git
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/vi-ku/setup_linux_dev.git

# Run the script file
cd Dev-Setup
/bin/bash setup.sh
```

Options:

- `SET_MIRRORS` (default `false`): set the source of package managers to open source mirrors at [TUNA (@China)](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn) to speed up downloading. (see [Packages](#packages) for more details). If you want to bypass the prompt, run:

  ```bash
  # Bypass the prompt
  SET_MIRRORS=true bash setup.sh    
  SET_MIRRORS=false bash setup.sh   # do not modify mirror settings
  ```

**Note**: If you are using **WSL on Windows**, you need to run [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) as **administrator** to get the permissions to copy fonts to `C:\Windows\Fonts`. Otherwise, the fonts will not be installed successfully on Windows. You can download them from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com) and install them manually. See [Font Settings](#font-settings) for more details.

After running the script, all the old configuration files involved will be backed up to the folder `${HOME}/.dotfiles/backups/<DATETIME>`, and a symbolic link `${HOME}/.dotfiles/backups/latest` will link to the latest one. You can compare the differences using:

```bash
# Compare the differences
colordiff -uEB ~/.dotfiles/backups/latest ~/.dotfiles
colordiff -uEB ~/.dotfiles/backups/latest/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

# Ignore miscellaneous directories
colordiff -uEB -x 'backups' -x '.dotfiles' ~/.dotfiles/backups/latest ~/.dotfiles
colordiff -uEB -x 'backups' ~/.dotfiles/backups/latest/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

There is a nice way to inspect and move changes from one version to another version of the same file using [`vimdiff`](https://www.vim.org) or [`meld`](http://meldmerge.org). Run:

```bash
# Inspect and move changes using vimdiff
vim -c "DirDiff ~/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/backups/latest/.dotfiles"
```

You can get vimdiff reference manual from [https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html](https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html), or type command `:help diff` inside Vim.

### Rollback

You can rollback to your previous dotfiles using:

```bash
# Rollback to the latest backup in "${HOME}/.dotfiles/backups/latest"
bash restore_dotfiles.sh

# Rollback to a specific version
bash restore_dotfiles.sh "${HOME}/.dotfiles/backups/<DATETIME>"
```

**Note**: the packages installed by [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) (see [Packages](#packages)) will remain in your system.

### Upgrade Packages

You can upgrade your packages just by running:

```bash
upgrade_packages
```

By default, `upgrade_packages` will not upgrade your conda environments. If you want to always keep your conda up-to-date, you can uncomment the corresponding line in `${HOME}/.dotfiles/utilities.sh`. Or run the script as:

```bash
upgrade_packages; upgrade_conda
```

### Font Settings

The login shell for the current user will be set to **`zsh`**. In order to get a wonderful and enjoyable terminal experience, please change your terminal font to a [**Nerd Font**](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). You can download any nerd font you like from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com) manually. The script will download and install [**`DejaVu Sans Mono Nerd Font`**](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/HEAD/patched-fonts/DejaVuSansMono) for **macOS**, **Linux** and **Windows** (**administrator privilege** is required to install fonts on Windows).

Configure your terminal to use nerd fonts:

- For macOS and Linux users, change the terminal font setting to "Nerd Font Complete" (e.g. `'DejaVuSansM Nerd Font Book'`).
- For WSL on Windows users, change the terminal font setting to "Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible" (e.g. `'DejaVuSansMono NF'`).

See [Font configurations for Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts) for more details.

Or use Zsh with Powerlevel10k Lean style:

```bash
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh-lean   # change the login shell
```

which do not need additional font settings.

![zsh-lean](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16078332/102495805-8cc45c00-40b1-11eb-8838-b5b64c434d33.png)

**Note**: If you are using **WSL on Windows**, you need to run [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) as **administrator** to get the permissions to copy fonts to `C:\Windows\Fonts`. If you forgot to obtain the appropriate privileges, you can open WSL in a new terminal window with administrator privilege. Then run the following command:

```bash
find -L ~/.local/share/fonts -not -empty -type f -name '*.tt[fc]' -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' bash -c \
    'file="{}"
    font=${file##*/}
    echo "Installing \"${font}\" to \"/mnt/c/Windows/Fonts\""
    cp -f "${file}" /mnt/c/Windows/Fonts
    /mnt/c/Windows/System32/reg.exe add "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Fonts" \
        /v "${font%.tt[fc]} (TrueType)" /t REG_SZ /d "${font}" /f'
```

## Customization

Make your own setup scripts. Add a new config file to the script:

1. fork this repository;
2. copy the contents of your config file to a temp file `temp.txt`;
3. replace all identifiers of your home directory with `${HOME}` in `temp.txt`;
4. replace all identifiers of your user name with `${USER}` in `temp.txt`;
5. replace all `\` with `\\` in `temp.txt`;
6. replace all `$` with `\$` in `temp.txt`;
7. add the following lines to script `setup_<OS_NAME>.sh`:

```bash
cd "${HOME}"   # this line has already been added at the top of the script

# Replace <CFG_FILE> with the config file's name
backup_dotfiles <CFG_FILE> .dotfiles/<CFG_FILE>

cat >.dotfiles/<CFG_FILE> <<EOF
# Paste the contents in the temp file `temp.txt` here
EOF

ln -sf .dotfiles/<CFG_FILE> .
```

8. add `<CFG_FILE>` and `.dotfiles/<CFG_FILE>` to `DOTFILES` in [`restore_dotfiles.sh`](restore_dotfiles.sh#L12).

## Packages

The source of package managers (Homebrew (macOS), APT (Ubuntu), Pacman (Manjaro), CPAN, Gem, Conda and Pip) will be set to the open source mirrors at [TUNA (@China)](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn).

The following packages will be setup:
